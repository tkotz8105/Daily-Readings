Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it.   During the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them walking on the sea.   When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified.   \u201cIt is a ghost,\u201d they said, and they cried out in fear.   At once Jesus spoke to them, \u201cTake courage, it is I; do not be afraid.\u201d   Peter said to him in reply, \u201cLord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.\u201d   He said, \u201cCome.\u201d   Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.   But when he saw how strong the wind was he became frightened; and, beginning to sink, he cried out, \u201cLord, save me!\u201d   Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught Peter, and said to him, \u201cO you of little faith, why did you doubt?\u201d   After they got into the boat, the wind died down.
