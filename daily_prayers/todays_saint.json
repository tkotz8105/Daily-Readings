Cajetan had the same feeling about the Council of Trent, held from 1545 to 1563. But as he said, God is the same in Naples as in Venice, with or without Trent or Vatican II. We open ourselves to God\u2019s power in whatever circumstances we find ourselves, and God\u2019s will is done. God\u2019s standards of success differ from ours."], "narrative": ["Like most of us, Cajetan seemed headed for an \u201cordinary\u201d life\u2014first as a lawyer, then as a priest engaged in the work of the Roman Curia.", "His life took a characteristic turn when he joined the Oratory of Divine Love in Rome, a group devoted to piety and charity, shortly after his ordination at 36. When he was 42 he founded a hospital for incurables at Venice. At Vicenza, he joined a \u201cdisreputable\u201d religious community that consisted only of men of the lowest stations of life\u2014and was roundly censured by his friends, who thought his action was a reflection on his family. He sought out the sick and poor of the town and served them.", "The greatest need of the time was the reformation of a Church that was \u201csick in head and members.\u201d Cajetan and three friends decided that the best road to reformation lay in reviving the spirit and zeal of the clergy. Together they founded a congregation known as the Theatines\u2014from Teate [Chieti] where their first superior-bishop had his see. One of the friends later became Pope Paul IV.", "They managed to escape to Venice after their house in Rome was wrecked when Emperor Charles V\u2019s troops sacked Rome in 1527. The Theatines were outstanding among the Catholic reform movements that took shape before the Protestant Reformation. Cajetan founded a monte de pieta\u2014\u201cmountain or fund of piety\u201d\u2014in Naples, one of many charitable, nonprofit credit organizations that lent money on the security of pawned objects. The purpose was to help the poor and protect them against usurers. Cajetan\u2019s little organization ultimately became the Bank of Naples, with great changes in policy."]}}
